# Day 11 – Name Generator from Alphabet

This is **Day 11 of my 90-Day Coding Series**.  
It’s a beginner-friendly Python script that generates random names in three different ways:

- **Start-With Mode:** Names that start with specific letters you choose.  
- **Allowed-Letters Mode:** Names built only from a set of letters you provide.  
- **Pronounceable Mode:** Names based on consonant–vowel patterns for a more natural look.

After each generated name, you can choose to quit or generate another one.

## How to Run

2. Download or copy the file `name_generator_day11.py` into a folder.
3. Open a terminal (Command Prompt) in that folder.


5. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a mode and generate names.
